TBD: Porting webDriver.py from the Roku Robot Framework to js

## WebDriverServer 

WebDriverServer is a binary compiled from the Go source code that Roku provided for [automated testing](https://github.com/rokudev/automated-channel-testing). It provides routing and handlers to forward commands to a Roku device. 

Note: this binary was compiled for OS X and will not work for Linux or Windows
